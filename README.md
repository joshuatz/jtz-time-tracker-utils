## CLI

### CLI - Setup

#### CLI - Installation

This package is available via the NPM registry, [under the name `jtz-time-tracker-utils`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jtz-time-tracker-utils).

You can install it with the NPM or Yarn commands you are used to, but some examples:

```sh
# Install globally
npm install -g jtz-time-tracker-utils
jttu --help
```

#### CLI - Configuration and Authentication

For configuring authentication (and possibly other config settings in the future), you will need a JSON file. By default, the CLI will look for one in your home directory, named `.jtz-time-tracker-utils.config.json`.

Current possible config values:

Key | Expected Value Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`HARVEST_PAT_ACCOUNT_ID` | `string \| number` | The *Account ID* associated with a harvest PAT ([see section below](#harvest-authentication)).
`HARVEST_PAT_TOKEN` | `string` | The actual *Token value* associated with a harvest PAT ([see section below](#harvest-authentication)).

### CLI - Commands

All commands are prefixed with the global registered entrypoint for the application:

- Prod:
	- `npx jtz-time-tracker-utils {COMMAND}`
	- `jttu {COMMAND}` (after installing globally with `npm -g jtz-time-tracker-utils`)
- Locally (dev)
	- `npx tsx ./cli.ts {COMMAND}`

Platform | Command | Description
--- | --- | ---
`harvest` ‚úÖ <br> `toggl` ‚ùå | `rollup` | Generates a "roll-up" report, by user, client, project, and task.
`harvest` ‚úÖ <br> `toggl` ‚ùå | `resume` | Resume the previously running time entry, with the start time set to right now.
`harvest` ‚úÖ <br> `toggl` ‚ùå | `stop` | Stop the currently running time entry.
`harvest` ‚úÖ <br> `toggl` ‚ùå | `status` | Display timer status / info.

> For any given command, you can use `--help` to see information about the available arguments.

## Application Specifics

### Harvest Authentication

Harvest authentication is done with a Personal Access Token (PAT). Head over to the [Harvest Developers page](https://id.getharvest.com/developers) to configure new (or view existing) PATs for your specific account.
